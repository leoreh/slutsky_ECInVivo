function f = plotFRchange(mat, varargin)

% recieves a matrix and plots each row as a line. can also plot the mean +
% std across columns. labels for the x axis (columns) can be defined. for
% example, can be used to plot the change in firing rate under different
% conditions and/or time windows.

% INPUT
% required:
%   mat       matrix of struct (see calcFR)
% optional:
%   avg         plot mean {1} or not (0)
%   labels      array of strings. one for each column of avgfr
%   basepath    recording session path {pwd} to save figure
%   saveFig     save figure (1) or not {0}
