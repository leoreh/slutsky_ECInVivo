function blfr = blFR(fr, varargin)

% for each unit calculates the mean / max FR within a window
%
% INPUT
% required:
%   fr          matrix of units (rows) x firing rate in time bins (columns)
% optional:
%   win         time window for calculation {[]}. index to fr.
%   method      calculate 'max' or 'avg' FR within win {'avg'}.
%
% OUTPUT
%   blfr       vector with mean / max FR across units (rows)
