function [frnorm, ithr, istable] = normFR(fr, varargin)

% normalizes FR according to maximum / average in a certain window.
% applies thershold to select high firing and/or stable units. 
% 
% INPUT
% required:
%   fr          matrix of units (rows) x firing rate in time bins (columns)
% optional:
%   metBL       method to calculate baseline as 'max' or {'avg'}.
%   win         time window for calculation {[]}. index to fr.
%   select      cell array with strings expressing method to select units.
%               'thr' - units with fr > 0.05 during baseline
%               'stable' - units with fr std < fr avg during baseline. 
%               default = none.
%
% OUTPUT        
%   frnorm      matrix of units (rows) x normalized firing rate in
%               time bins (columns).
%   ithr        logical vector of units with FR above thr
%   istable     logical vector of units with stable firing
