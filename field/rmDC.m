function [sig, dc] = rmDC(sig, varargin)

% removes DC from signal by calculating mean in window (baseline)
%  
% INPUT
%   sig         numeric array. if matrix, baseline is calculated separatly
%               for each column
%   winCalc     time window for calculating DC {[1 Inf]}. specified as
%               index to vec.
% 
% OUTPUT
%   sig         input singal without DC component   
%   dc          mean signal in window
