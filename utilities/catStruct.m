% catstruct = catstruct(varargin)
%
% loads *structname*.mat from all folders and subfolders in parentdir and
% concatenates the struct fields. for example, can be used to concatenate
% spikes from multiple sessions.
%
% INPUT:
%   parentdir       path to recording folder {pwd}.
%   structname      basename of saved struct {*spikes.cellinfo*}.
% 
% OUTPUT:
%   catstruct       concatenated structure 
%
% 01 dec 18 LH.     Updates:
% 08 dec 17 -       handling different field classes 
% 
% TO DO LIST:
%   fix cat of mats. currently creates cell within cell (e.g. spindices)
%   add field indicating origins (i.e. unit x came from file y)
