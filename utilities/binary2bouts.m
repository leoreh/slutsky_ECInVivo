function [bouts, nbouts] = binary2bouts(varargin)

% gets a binary vector and returns the start \ stop times of bouts. can be
% used for BS, ripples, anesthesia states etc. accounts for inter-bout
% interval and duration. note that bout defines start including idx and
% stop not including idx [). this is for legacy purposes. 
% 
% INPUT
%       vec         binary vector 
%       exclude     logical. exclude incomplete events (1) or not {0}.
%       minDur      minimum duration of bout
%       maxDur      maximum duration of bout
%       interDur    maximum inter-bout interval
%       flgPrnt     logical. print to screen the number of bouts
%
% OUTPUT
%       bouts      n x 2 mat where n is the number of events and the
%                   columns represent the start and end of each event [samps]
%       nbouts     struct with fields describing number of bouts detected
%                   in each step
%
