function [bursty, bpeak, bi] = isbursty(varargin)

% this function defines a cell as bursty if (1) there is a local maximum in
% the isi log distribution between blim {[1.5 8]} and (2) if the ratio
% between isis within blim and total isi is greater than bratio {0.05}.
% based on Medrihan et al., 2017.
%
% INPUT
%   spktimes    a cell array of vectors. each vector (unit) contains the

% OUTPUT

%
% DEPENDENCIES
%   gaussFilt       from TSToolbox
%
% TO DO LIST
