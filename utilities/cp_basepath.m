function cp_basepath(varargin)
% CP_BASEPATH Copies files from a session directory to a new location.
%
% SUMMARY:
% This function copies files from a single session directory to a new location
% while maintaining the mouse/session directory structure. For example, files
% from 'E:\Data\lh140\lh140_230624_090049\*.clu.1' will be copied to
% 'D:\Data\lh140\lh140_230624_090049\*.clu.1'. Uses PowerShell's robocopy
% for faster file operations.
%
% METHODOLOGY:
% The function extracts the mouse name and session name from the basepath,
% creates corresponding directories in the new location, and copies the files
% while maintaining the original structure. Supports wildcard patterns in
% filenames (e.g., '*.clu.1', '*.session.mat*'). Uses robocopy for efficient
% file copying.
%
% INPUT (Optional Key-Value Pairs):
%   fNames       (cell array) Cell array of file patterns to copy. Can include
%                wildcards (e.g., '*.clu.1', '*.session.mat*'). Each pattern
%                will be expanded to match all files in the session directory.
%   basepath     (char) Full path to the session directory (e.g., 
%                'E:\Data\lh140\lh140_230624_090049')
%   newpath      (char) New base path where files will be copied to. If empty,
%                uses 'D:\Data'. {[]}
%   overwrite    (logical) Flag to overwrite existing files. {false}
%   verbose      (logical) Flag to display progress information. {false}
%
% OUTPUT:
%   None. Files are copied to the new location.

% HISTORY:
%   Aug 2024 (AI Assisted) - Created function with input parsing and
%                            enhanced documentation
%             - Added support for wildcard patterns in filenames
%             - Added verbose option for progress display
%             - Switched to PowerShell robocopy for faster file operations
%             - Optimized to use single robocopy call for all files
