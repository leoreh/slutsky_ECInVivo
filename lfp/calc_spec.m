function spec = calc_spec(varargin)

% calculates the multitaper spectrogram via chronux with refinements from
% accusleep. data can be loaded from .lfp or provided as input.
% multichannel support includes averaging channels (e.g. electrodes from
% the same tetrode) or avergaing spectrograms across channels and/or
% calculating the spectrogram separately for groups of channels. these are
% determined by the input 'ch'
% see wonderful explanation of multitaper estimates here:
% https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qTD7qtHius
%
% INPUT
%   basepath    char. fullpath to recording folder {pwd}
%   sig         lfp signal. if matrix assumes columns are samples and rows
%               are channels. if empty will load from (basename).lfp
%               according to ch
%   ch          cell of vecs depicting groups of channels (indices to the
%               rows of sig) whose spectrogram should be averaged. this is
%               done in mtspectrumc.m. if sig is loaded from binary then
%               averaging will be done on the lfp traces. for example, this
%               can be used for tetrodes (i.e. ch = spkgrp) and/or to
%               compare eeg w/ lfp signals
%   fs          sampling frequency {1250}.
%   ftarget     numeric. requested frequency range and resolution. this 
%               determines the range passed to chronux but the actual
%               resolution depends (1) on the time resolution, i.e. winstep
%               and fs, and (2) the degree of zero padding chunks of the
%               signal ('pad'). the output of chronux is interpolated by
%               nearest neighbors to the requested frequencies
%   padfft      numeric. zero pad chunks of the data to the next pow2
%               when applying fft. 0 means yes -1 means no. see mtspecgramc.m
%   winstep     numeric. determines the time resolution of the spectrogram.
%               for accusleep should be equal to bout length. {1} [sec]
%   window      numeric. smoothing window of the spectrogram.
%   logfreq     logical. plot freq axis on logscale {false}. requires
%               that ftarget be log-spaced
%   force       logical. re-analyze even if spec file exists
%   graphics    logical. plot figure {false}
%   saveVar     logical. organize and save struct {true}
% 
% OUTPUT
%   spec        struct with fields:
%   s           spectrogram time x frequency x groups of channels.

% TO DO LIST
%       # find a way to set request freqs in a log scale (done)
%       # normalize spectrogram (~done)
%       # separate graphics to stand alone (done)
%       # calc power in bands (e.g. delta / theta) (done)
%       # overcome tradeoff between freq and time resolution. perhaps by
%       calculating spec separately for low frequencies or by using wavelet

% 13 jan 20 LH      updates:

% 25 feb 22         adapted mtspecgramc
% 18 apr 22         multichannel support
% 26 apr 22         bands
% 29 may 22         band through sum instead of mean
% 30 dec 24         added window as input (for spec outlier detection)
