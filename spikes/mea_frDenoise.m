function fr = mea_frDenoise(frOrig, t, varargin)
% MEAFRDENOISE Applies Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth firing rate data.
%
% SUMMARY:
% This function applies a Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth firing rate data
% while preserving important temporal features. This method is chosen for
% its ability to smooth data while preserving the shape of important
% features like sharp onsets/offsets, peaks, and non-monotonic trends
% (e.g., recovery with overshoot).
%
% INPUT (Required):
%   frOrig       - Matrix of raw firing rate values [Hz]. Units are rows.
%   t            - Time vector corresponding to firing rate data [s].
%
% INPUT (Optional Key-Value Pairs):
%   flgPlot      - Logical flag to generate smoothing visualization {false}.
%   polyOrder    - Polynomial order for Savitzky-Golay filter {3}.
%   frameLenSec  - Frame length for Savitzky-Golay filter [s] {600}.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   fr           - Matrix of smoothed firing rate values [Hz]. Same size as frOrig.
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%   Signal Processing Toolbox (for sgolayfilt)
%
% HISTORY:
%   Sep 2024 - Extracted from mea_frRecovery.m as standalone function.

% FILTER PARAMETER SETUP
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Calculate the filter frame length in number of bins (samples)
dt = mean(diff(t)); % Average sampling interval
frameLen = round(frameLenSec / dt);

% Savitzky-Golay filter requires an odd frame length.
if mod(frameLen, 2) == 0
    frameLen = frameLen + 1;
end

% The polynomial order must be less than the frame length.
if polyOrder >= frameLen
    polyOrder = frameLen - 1;
